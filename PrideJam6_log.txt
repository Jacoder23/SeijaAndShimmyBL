There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

May even your wish come true, someday.

Children
{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

was all it was.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {i}wish boy?{/i}
