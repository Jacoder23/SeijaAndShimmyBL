There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a

You nearly lose your footing but try for a counterattack.


exec: exec
But your timing's been read and Backswitch lays into you.

Backswitch
Dumbfuck.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

15
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.


exec: exec
A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}gone wrong as a wardrobe full of costumes
goes flying right as you roll, straight into your face.

The last thing you see before you collapse onto the ground is his mask. You
can tell he's got the ugliest smirk behind it.

Being the hero.

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin

You clasp his hands and ask.

16
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch blocks the telegraphed attack but the sheer force sends him
backpedaling, wincing.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

15
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.


exec: exec
A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}that you manage to keep as you catch your
breath between daring manuevers, much to Backswitch's ire.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Wishmaker
Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
Backtalk, smacktalk.

Backswitch
You know who you really need to watch out for? Truck drivers.

Wishmaker
Wait, what does that m-{nw}

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Wishmaker
What does that-

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING

Everyone's thought about it once.

Being the hero.

Shin
{i}But despite getting superpowers...{/i}

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin
{i}...I never get to be the hero.{/i}

You clasp his hands and ask.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin

Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch stifles a pained grunt.

You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

Backswitch is hit squarely in the chest.

He backs away a step while gasping for air.

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a

You nearly lose your footing but try for a counterattack.


exec: exec
But your timing's been read and Backswitch lays into you.

Backswitch
Dumbfuck.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You move even lower, a poor move, as the manhole cover sweeps your legs and
you land with your back against the ground.

The scramble afterwards to get back into a fighting stance is less graceful
than you'd hoped.

The last thing you see before you collapse onto the ground is his mask. You
can tell he's got the ugliest smirk behind it.

Shin
This report's going nowhere.

You got up and left the building. On your way out, somebody taps you on the
shoulder.

???
Hey.

You turn around, only to get a cold drink to the face as you do.

Sekibanki
Want a drink?

You take the can of carbonated sweet sickness from his hands before placing it
and your laptop off to the side.

Shin
Good guess, but water's my preference.

Shin
So how was it? The training exercises.

Sekibanki
Usual. The other city's team leader kept arguing with Reimu and we didn't get
anything done.

Shin
Ah.

You went back to typing to try and keep your thought off the fact they didn't
bother bring you.

Sekibanki
Not trying to exaggerate for your sake by the way. It was truly awful.

Sekibanki
What about you? You finish the report?

Shin
Yeah, well, part of it at least.

Sekibanki
Run me through it then. Maybe I can help jog your memory.

Shin
Well at first. it went about as normal as usual.

Shin
A normal kids event, you know, cause-

You glanced at his reaction, squirming a sliver, knowing your next words.

Sekibanki
I'm not allowed {fast}to actually patrol.

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}{color=000000}wish boy?{/color}{/bt}

10
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch
Idiot.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch sidesteps your swing and sends a prop sword flying at your face.

You parry it as well as you can but still get a bit roughed up.

Backswitch
Iiiiiiidiot.

You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

16
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.


exec: exec

exec: exec

exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a
counterpunch.


exec: exec
You take it on your jaw and the world becomes blurry.

You grit your way through the pain.


exec: exec
While dazed, you tackle Backswitch and land a shot to his knees that make him
buckle.

Backswitch
{sc}{color=000}FUCK!{/color}{/sc}

exec: exec
Tutorial
Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way. Backswitch seems genuinely
surprised.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Wishmaker
Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
Backtalk, smacktalk.

Backswitch
You know who you really need to watch out for? Truck drivers.

Wishmaker
Wait, what does that m-{nw}

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Wishmaker
What does that-

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Everyone's thought about it once.

Being the hero.

Shin
{i}But despite getting superpowers...{/i}

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin
{i}...I never get to be the hero.{/i}

You clasp his hands and ask.

Shin
Do you {gradient2=6-E40303-FF8C00-2-FF8C00-FFED00-2-FFED00-008026-2-008026-004

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way. Backswitch seems genuinely
surprised.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

10
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch stifles a pained grunt.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

Backswitch is hit squarely in the chest.

He backs away a step while gasping for air.

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a

But your timing's been read and Backswitch lays into you.

Backswitch
Dumbfuck.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Wishmaker
Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
Backtalk, smacktalk.

Backswitch
You know who you really need to watch out for? Truck drivers.

Wishmaker
Huh? What does that m-{nw}

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Wishmaker
What does that-

But Backswitch was already running away.

Everyone's thought about it once.

Being the hero.

Shin
{i}But despite getting superpowers...{/i}

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin
{i}...I never get to be the hero.{/i}

You clasp his hands and ask.

Shin

It's the day after your fight.

You're in the lounge of Hero HQ, chicken pecking at your keyboard.

Shin
And as I finished… my… signature… line…

Shin
...

Shin
This report's going nowhere.

You got up and left the building. On your way out, somebody taps you on the
shoulder.

???
Hey.

You turn around, only to get a cold drink to the face as you do.

Sekibanki
Want a drink?

You take the can of carbonated sweet sickness from his hands before placing it
and your laptop off to the side.

Shin
Good guess, but water's my preference.

Shin
So how was it? The training exercises.

Sekibanki
Usual. The other city's team leader kept arguing with Reimu and we didn't get
anything done.

Shin
Ah.

You went back to typing to try and keep your thought off the fact they didn't
bother bring you.

Sekibanki
Not trying to exaggerate for your sake by the way. It was truly awful.

Sekibanki
What about you? You finish the report?

Shin
Yeah, well, part of it at least.

Sekibanki
Run me through it then. Maybe I can help jog your memory.

Shin
Well at first. it went about as normal as usual.

Shin
A normal kids event, you know, cause-

You glanced at his reaction, squirming a sliver, knowing your next words.

Sekibanki
I'm not allowed {fast}to actually patrol.

Sekibanki
I know, we all know.

Sekibanki
Let's put the aside though. Where're you headed?

One wrong turn on the streets on your day off and you find yourself lost.

The everpresence of the Hero HQ over the city would make for a good landmark,
especially given how close you live to it...

But you feel like you're heading farther from it rather than closer.

Shin
{i}Ah crap.{/i}

Which way do you go?

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}{color=000000}wish boy?{/color}{/bt}

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch
Idiot.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch sidesteps your swing and sends a prop sword flying at your face.

You parry it as well as you can but still get a bit roughed up.

Backswitch
Iiiiiiidiot.

Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way. Backswitch seems genuinely
surprised.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

16
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch blocks the telegraphed attack but the sheer force sends him
backpedaling, wincing.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Wishmaker
Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
Backtalk, smacktalk.

Backswitch
You know who you really need to watch out for? Truck drivers.

Wishmaker
Huh? What does that m-{nw}

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Wishmaker
What does that-

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING

Everyone's thought about it once.

Being the hero.

Shin
{i}But despite getting superpowers...{/i}

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin
{i}...I never get to be the hero.{/i}

You clasp his hands and ask.

Shin
Do you {gradient2=6-E40303-FF8C00-2-FF8C00-FFED00-2-FFED00-008026-2-008026-004

One wrong turn on the streets on your day off and you find yourself lost.

The everpresence of the Hero HQ over the city would make for a good landmark,
especially given how close you live to it...

But you feel like you're heading farther from it rather than closer.

Shin
{i}Ah crap.{/i}

Which way do you go?

Choice: Left
Choice: Right

Player chose: Left

You pass by a series of shanties, haphazardly constructed.

They're built so close to each other you wonder if they support each others
load: the other shanties-- the only reason they haven't all collapsed.

Like dominos.

You leave, hoping no one knocks them over.

Which way do you go?

Choice: Left
Choice: Right

Player chose: Left

You see a storefront with pages on pages but it isn't a bookstore.

Hanging by its doorstep is a black flag with two arrows, blue and red,
wrapping around each other like a yin-yang in its center. One is going up, one
is going down.

Marking territory. You were briefed on some supervillains involved in
racketeering.

You walk on by with a bad taste in your mouth.

Eventually, your eye is caught by a splash of color. A doorway with…

Shin
{i}Shower curtains?{/i}

You stop and stare for a second at the colorful little storefront, an
anachronism, something fit for the backside of a community center from last
decade.

Your better sense tells you to move on before you get scammed.

But you decide you've been lost long enough to ask for directions.

Shin
Hello?

The sound of boxes on boxes being dug through comes from behind the counter.

Kogasa
Oh, a customer? I'll be right there!

A man with bright blue hair and striking blue and red eyes stands up a bit too
fast, accidentally taking a mouthful of wind chimes.

Kogasa
WhIgjs-{nw}

He spits the chimes out.

Kogasa
Welcome to the Rainshade, I'm Kogasa! What can I do you for? I mean, do for
you?

Shin
Uh, hi? I just needed directions, I'm headed to the Hero HQ. Well,
thereabouts.

Kogasa deflates.

Kogasa
Oh, just exit then go left until you can't anymore and then turn around and
start going right.

Shin
Wouldn't that just=

Kogasa
I know it sounds like you'll end up back here but trust me. It just works out.

Shin
Okay... thanks?

You move to leave but…

Shin
{i}I am off-duty, wouldn't it be fine to stick around a little?{/i}

Shin
{i}And plus, it'd be nice to do a good thing even outside of work hours.{/i}

Shin
Also, you sell stuff here?

Kogasa seems to perk up.

Kogasa
Yeah, we do! You wanna see?

Kogasa
Thanks for stopping by!

Shin
And thank you, Kogasa. I'm Shin by the way.

Kogasa
I see. It's nice to meet you, Shin!

Shin
I'll be seeing you around. Goodbye.

Kogasa
Buh-bye!

Which way do you go?

Choice: Left

Player chose: Left

You keep going left, and then left again, and then again, and again.

Eventually, you come to a dead end.

You follow Kogasa's instructions to turn around and start heading right.

Which way do you go?

Choice: Right

Player chose: Right

You pass by a tall, concrete apartment. Cracks form not only at its base but
all throughout, giving the feeling that it hasn't been well maintained in a
long time.

Your family once lived somewhere like this, subsidized, paid in part by the
government. DIfferent cities, same idea.

Now you're a world away from who you were then.

Familiar as it is, it's not the familiar you're looking for so you move on.

Which way do you go?

Choice: Right

Player chose: Right

You pass by a series of posters, slashed at until you're unable to tell what
the ink was advocating. You knew only its demise.

In its place, the beginnings of a mural are being painted in luscious strokes
of aerosol. You think you can make out some words but it's clearly at a
reading level above your age.

Like "DVCK" sprawled out in some kind of cursive. You think it might resemble
another word, mispelled on purpose.

Of course, you mean duck.

Which way do you go?

Choice: Right

Player chose: Right

Eventually, you make your way back to Hero HQ.

Shin
{i}Home, just the sweetest, of homes.{/i}

It's the day after your fight.

You're in the lounge of Hero HQ, chicken pecking at your keyboard.

Shin
And as I finished… my… signature… line…

Shin
...

Shin
This report's going nowhere.

You got up and left the building. On your way out, somebody taps you on the
shoulder.

???
Hey.

You turn around, only to get a cold drink to the face as you do.

Sekibanki
Want a drink?

You take the can of carbonated sweet sickness from his hands before placing it
and your laptop off to the side.

Shin
Good guess, but water's my preference.

Shin
So how was it? The training exercises.

Sekibanki
Usual. The other city's team leader kept arguing with Reimu and we didn't get
anything done.

Shin
Ah.

You went back to typing to try and keep your thought off the fact they didn't
bother bring you.

Sekibanki
Not trying to exaggerate for your sake by the way. It was truly awful.

Sekibanki
What about you? You finish the report?

Shin
Yeah, well, part of it at least.

Sekibanki
Run me through it then. Maybe I can help jog your memory.

Shin
Well at first. it went about as normal as usual.

Shin
A normal kids event, you know, cause-

You glanced at his reaction, squirming a sliver, knowing your next words.

Sekibanki
I'm not allowed {fast}to actually patrol.

Sekibanki
I know, we all know.

Sekibanki
Let's put the aside though. Where're you headed?

After training's over at Hero HQ, you head out when Sekibanki catches up to
you.

Sekibanki
Good work today, got another order of supplies for tomorrow. Energy drinks and
the like.

Shin
Another supply run? Is there no one else available?

Sekibanki
You and I both know the others are just giving you things to do around here.

Sekibanki
They're trying to make you feel a part of the team, yknow?

Shin
But what about you?

It would be an understatement to say it was bit of a shock for you when you
got your powers a month ago.

It would be another understatement to say it was surprising to find out that
the heroes of the city lived in...

...something less like the sci-fi movie military headquarters and more like a
recreation room that got stretched out to fill an entire floor.

And it would be an even bigger understatement to say that Aegaeon wasn't the
team player everyone made him out to be: chatty in public, shy behind doors.

He was less the glue holding everyone together and more so the introvert who
could put in the effort to reach out from time to time.

Even so, the lion's share of your interactions with heroes have been with
Sekibanki.

Sekibanki
That's just who I am. I don't hate people, I just like being alone sometimes.

Shin
But that's not really the case for me.

Sekibanki
No it's not.

Sekibanki turns towards you.

Sekibanki
I can't force the others to warm up to you but honestly?

Sekibanki
I think I just plain old like you.

Shin
{i}I- uh? Did I hear that right?{/i}

Sekibanki
You're a good person. That's more than most of us can say.

Shin
{i}Oh. He meant that.{/i}

Shin
Wait, "most of us"?

There was something a little solemn about his expression when he answered me.

Sekibanki
Yeah.

You could see him bite his lip, maybe thinking what to say.

Sekibanki
Make sure you always walk the high road, Shin.

You weren't sure how to respond to that. You just kept walking.

Shin
I... I will.

Sekibanki
Good.

You shook off any further thoughts.

Shin
I'll get going so I can get a head start on these supplies tomorrow.

Sekibanki
ALright, then see you later!

Shin
See you!

Shin

After training's over at Hero HQ, you head out when Sekibanki catches up to
you.

Sekibanki
Good work today, got another order of supplies for tomorrow. Energy drinks and
the like.

Shin
Another supply run? Is there no one else available?

Sekibanki
You and I both know the others are just giving you things to do around here.

Sekibanki
They're trying to make you feel a part of the team, yknow?

Shin
But what about you?

It would be an understatement to say it was bit of a shock for you when you
got your powers a month ago.

It would be another understatement to say it was surprising to find out that
the heroes of the city lived in...

...something less like the sci-fi movie military headquarters and more like a
recreation room that got stretched out to fill an entire floor.

And it would be an even bigger understatement to say that Aegaeon wasn't the
team player everyone made him out to be: chatty in public, shy behind doors.

He was less the glue holding everyone together and more so the introvert who
could put in the effort to reach out from time to time.

Even so, the lion's share of your interactions with heroes have been with
Sekibanki.

Sekibanki
That's just who I am. I don't hate people, I just like being alone sometimes.

Shin
But that's not really the case for me.

Sekibanki
No it's not.

Sekibanki turns towards you.

Sekibanki
I can't force the others to warm up to you but honestly?

Sekibanki
I think I just plain old like you.

Shin
{i}I- uh? Did I hear that right?{/i}

Sekibanki
You're a good person. That's more than most of us can say.

Shin
{i}Oh. He meant that.{/i}

Shin
Wait, "most of us"?

There was something a little solemn about his expression when he answered me.

Sekibanki
Yeah.

You could see him bite his lip, maybe thinking what to say.

Sekibanki
Make sure you always walk the high road, Shin.

You weren't sure how to respond to that. You just kept walking.

Shin
I... I will.

Sekibanki
Good.

You shook off any further thoughts.

Shin
I'll get going so I can get a head start on these supplies tomorrow.

Sekibanki
ALright, then see you later!

Shin
See you!

Shin

Shin

Sekibanki
Good work today, got another order of supplies for tomorrow. Energy drinks and
the like.

Shin
Another supply run? Is there no one else available?

Sekibanki
You and I both know the others are just giving you things to do around here.

Sekibanki
They're trying to make you feel a part of the team, yknow?

Shin
But what about you?

It would be an understatement to say it was bit of a shock for you when you
got your powers a month ago.

It would be another understatement to say it was surprising to find out that
the heroes of the city lived in...

...something less like the sci-fi movie military headquarters and more like a
recreation room that got stretched out to fill an entire floor.

And it would be an even bigger understatement to say that Aegaeon wasn't the
team player everyone made him out to be: chatty in public, shy behind doors.

He was less the glue holding everyone together and more so the introvert who
could put in the effort to reach out from time to time.

Even so, the lion's share of your interactions with heroes have been with
Sekibanki.

Sekibanki
That's just who I am. I don't hate people, I just like being alone sometimes.

Shin
But that's not really the case for me.

Sekibanki
No it's not.

Sekibanki turns towards you.

Sekibanki
I can't force the others to warm up to you but honestly?

Sekibanki
I think I just plain old like you.

Shin
{i}I- uh? Did I hear that right?{/i}

Sekibanki
You're a good person. That's more than most of us can say.

Shin
{i}Oh. He meant that.{/i}

Shin
Wait, "most of us"?

There was something a little solemn about his expression when he answered me.

Sekibanki
Yeah.

You could see him bite his lip, maybe thinking what to say.

Sekibanki
Make sure you always walk the high road, Shin.

You weren't sure how to respond to that. You just kept walking.

Shin
I... I will.

Sekibanki
Good.

You shook off any further thoughts.

Shin
I'll get going so I can get a head start on these supplies tomorrow.

Sekibanki
ALright, then see you later!

Shin
See you!
