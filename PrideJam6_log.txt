There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Wishmaker.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}wish boy?{/bt}

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

Tutorial
Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-

renpy.jump('dice_animation')
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

global pacifism; pacifism += 1
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.

renpy.jump('dice_animation')
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.
