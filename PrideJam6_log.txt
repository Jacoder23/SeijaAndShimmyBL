Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Wishmaker.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Wishmaker.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Wishmaker.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}wish boy?{/bt}

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Wishmaker.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}wish boy?{/bt}

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}wish boy?{/bt}

You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

10
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch stifles a pained grunt.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch sidesteps your swing and sends a prop sword flying at your face.

You parry the prop sword, reading Backswitch's rhythm.

16
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch blocks the telegraphed attack but the sheer force sends him
backpedaling, wincing.

exec: exec
Tutorial
Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

15
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.


exec: exec
A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}gone wrong as a wardrobe full of costumes
goes flying right as you roll, straight into your face.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As

But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way. Backswitch seems genuinely
surprised.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch
Idiot.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

He backs away a step while gasping for air.

You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

You take it on your jaw and the world becomes blurry.

You grit your way through the pain.

While dazed, you tackle Backswitch and land a shot to his knees that make him
buckle.

calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}{color=000000}wish boy?{/color}{/bt}

You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

10
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch

Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

15
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.


exec: exec
A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}that you manage to keep as you catch your
breath between daring manuevers, much to Backswitch's ire.

In a brief respite you get as you dodge Backswitch's onslaught, leaving him
panting for a moment, you tap your communicator and send out backup signal.

Let's hope your fellow heroes get here in time.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch is hit squarely in the chest.

He backs away a step while gasping for air.

16
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch blocks the telegraphed attack but the sheer force sends him
backpedaling, wincing.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Wishmaker
Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
uhhh author note: write something here witty that sekibanki can counter but
that also confuses shin

???
sekibanki's counter

calls from the skies.

Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was

make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a

You attempt to-

But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way. Backswitch seems genuinely
surprised.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

10
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch
Idiot.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch sidesteps your swing and sends a prop sword flying at your face.

You parry it as well as you can but still get a bit roughed up.

Backswitch
Iiiiiiidiot.

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a
counterpunch.

You nearly lose your footing but try for a counterattack.


exec: exec
But your timing's been read and Backswitch lays into you.

Backswitch
Dumbfuck.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You move even lower, a poor move, as the manhole cover sweeps your legs and
you land with your back against the ground.

The scramble afterwards to get back into a fighting stance is less graceful
than you'd hoped.

15
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.


exec: exec
A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}gone wrong as a wardrobe full of costumes
goes flying right as you roll, straight into your face.

The last thing you see before you collapse onto the ground is his mask. You
can tell he's got the ugliest smirk behind it.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

You pass by a series of shanties, haphazardly constructed.

They're built so close to each other you wonder if they support each others

Player chose: Left

You see a storefront with pages on pages but it isn't a bookstore.

There's a black flag with the first letter of the alphabet on it. A circle
adorns the symbol like a crown.

You don't really know what the flag means or what its called but you know how
you feel about it, the imagery, the visual imagination.

It's not founded in anything concrete. You never really sat down and looked
into it.

But you're a superhero. You bring order. Your job is the opposite of it. Don't
think so hard.

Eventually, your eye is caught by a splash of color. A doorway with…

Shin
{i}Shower curtains?{/i}

You stop and stare for a second at the colorful little storefront, an
anachronism, something fit for the backside of a community center from last
decade.

Your better sense tells you to move on before you get scammed.

But you decide you've been lost long enough to ask for directions.

I know it sounds like you'll end up back here but trust me. It just works out.

You pass by a tall, concrete apartment. Cracks form not only at its base but
all throughout, giving the feeling that it hasn't been well maintained in a
long time.

Your family once lived somewhere like this, subsidized, paid in part by the
government. DIfferent cities, same idea.

Now you're a world away from who you were then.

Familiar as it is, it's not the familiar you're looking for so you move on.

Which way do you go?

You pass by a series of posters, slashed at until you're unable to tell what
the ink was advocating. You knew only its demise.

In its place, the beginnings of a mural are being painted in luscious strokes
of aerosol. You think you can make out some words but it's clearly at a
reading level above your age.

Like "DVCK" sprawled out in some kind of cursive. You think it might resemble
another word, mispelled on purpose.

Of course, you mean duck.

Eventually, your eye is caught by a splash of color. A doorway with…

Shin
{i}Shower curtains?{/i}

You stop and stare for a second at the colorful little storefront, an
anachronism, something fit for the backside of a community center from last
decade.

Your better sense tells you to move on before you get scammed.

But you decide you've been lost long enough to ask for directions.

Shin
Hello?

The sound of boxes on boxes being dug through comes from behind the counter.

Kogasa
Oh, a customer? I'll be right there!

A man with bright blue hair and striking blue and red eyes stands up a bit too
fast, accidentally taking a mouthful of wind chimes.

Kogasa
WhIgjs-{nw}

He spits the chimes out.

Kogasa
Welcome to the Witch Stitch, I'm Kogasa! What can I do you for? I mean, do for
you?

Shin
Uh, hi? I just needed directions, I'm headed to the Hero HQ.

Kogasa deflates.

Kogasa
Oh, just exit then go left until you can't anymore and then turn around and
start going right.

Shin
Wouldn't that just=

Kogasa
I know it sounds like you'll end up back here but trust me. It just works out.

Shin
Okay... thanks?

You move to leave but…

Shin
{i}I am off-duty, wouldn't it be fine to stick around a little?{/i}

Shin
{i}And plus, it'd be nice to do a good thing even outside of work hours.{/i}

Shin
Also, you sell stuff here?

Kogasa seems to perk up.

Kogasa
Yeah, we do! You wanna see?

Kogasa
Thanks for stopping by!

Shin
And thank you, Kogasa. I'm Shin by the way.

Kogasa
I see. It's nice to meet you, Shin!

Shin
I'll be seeing you around. Goodbye.

Kogasa
Buh-bye!

You pass by a series of shanties, haphazardly constructed.

They're built so close to each other you wonder if they support each others
load: the other shanties-- the only reason they haven't all collapsed.

Like dominos.

You leave, hoping no one knocks them over.

You see a storefront with pages on pages but it isn't a bookstore.

There's a black flag with the first letter of the alphabet on it. A circle
adorns the symbol like a crown.

You don't really know what the flag means or what its called but you know how
you feel about it, the imagery, the visual imagination.

It's not founded in anything concrete. You never really sat down and looked
into it.

But you're a superhero. You bring order. Your job is the opposite of it. Don't
think so hard.

Eventually, you come to a dead end.

You follow Kogasa's instructions to turn around and start heading right.
