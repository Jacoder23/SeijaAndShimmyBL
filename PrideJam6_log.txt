There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}{color=000000}wish boy?{/color}{/bt}

Tutorial
Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch

You attempt to-

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a

You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin
{i}...I never get to be the hero.{/i}

You clasp his hands and ask.

You got up and left the building. On your way out, somebody taps you on the

Hey.

You turn around, only to get a cold drink to the face as you do.

Sekibanki
Want a drink?

You take the can of carbonated sweet sickness from his hands before placing it
and your laptop off to the side.

Shin
Good guess, but water's my preference.

Shin
So how was it? The training exercises.

Sekibanki
Usual. The other city's team leader kept arguing with Reimu and we didn't get
anything done.

Shin
Ah.

You went back to typing to try and keep your thought off the fact they didn't
bother bring you.

Sekibanki
Not trying to exaggerate for your sake by the way. It was truly awful.

Sekibanki
What about you? You finish the report?

Shin
Yeah, well, part of it at least.

Sekibanki
Run me through it then. Maybe I can help jog your memory.

Shin
Well at first. it went about as normal as usual.

Shin
A normal kids event, you know, cause-

You glanced at his reaction, squirming a sliver, knowing your next words.

Seija lies at your feet in a collapsed heap of exhaust and hacking coughs.

Backswitch
H-heh. You're better than expected, for a kids show hero.

Backswitch
Don't you think you could achieve more if they-

You give her a light kick to the ribs to shut her up. Very light.

Wishmaker
Nice of you to choose an ambush right outside of Hero HQ. The commute to
jail's going to be a lot faster.

Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
Backtalk, smacktalk.

Backswitch
You know who you really need to watch out for? Truck drivers.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,

This report's going nowhere.

You got up and left the building. On your way out, somebody taps you on the
shoulder.

Hey.

You turn around, only to get a cold drink to the face as you do.

Sekibanki
Want a drink?

You take the can of carbonated sweet sickness from his hands before placing it
and your laptop off to the side.

Shin
Good guess, but water's my preference.

Shin
So how was it? The training exercises.

Sekibanki
Usual. The other city's team leader kept arguing with Reimu and we didn't get
anything done.

Shin
Ah.

You went back to typing to try and keep your thought off the fact they didn't
bother bring you.

Sekibanki
Not trying to exaggerate for your sake by the way. It was truly awful.

Sekibanki
What about you? You finish the report?

Shin
Yeah, well, part of it at least.

Sekibanki
Run me through it then. Maybe I can help jog your memory.

Shin
Well at first. it went about as normal as usual.

Shin
A normal kids event, you know, cause-

You glanced at his reaction, squirming a sliver, knowing your next words.

I'm not allowed {fast}to actually patrol.
