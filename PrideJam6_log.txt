But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it

Backswitch

But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

global precision; precision += 1
You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

global violence; violence += 0.5
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch points at your weapon and sends you it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch
Idiot.

global violence; violence += 1
global dmg_to_target; dmg_to_target = 4
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

Backswitch is hit squarely in the chest.

He backs away a step while gasping for air.

global violence; violence += 1
global dmg_to_target; dmg_to_target = 5
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch blocks the telegraphed attack but the sheer force sends him
backpedaling, wincing.

global pacifism; pacifism += 1
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.

You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

global dmg_to_self; dmg_to_self = 3
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.

A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}gone wrong as a wardrobe full of costumes
goes flying right as you roll, straight into your face.

global team_player; team_player += 1
In a brief respite you get as you dodge Backswitch's onslaught, leaving him
panting for a moment, you tap your communicator and send out backup signal.

Let's hope your fellow heroes get here in time.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Wishmaker.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

She's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {sc}wish boy?{/sc}

But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

global precision; precision += 1
You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

global pacifism; pacifism += 1
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.

You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

global dmg_to_self; dmg_to_self = 3
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.

A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}gone wrong as a wardrobe full of costumes
goes flying right as you roll, straight into your face.

global team_player; team_player += 1
In a brief respite you get as you dodge Backswitch's onslaught, leaving him
panting for a moment, you tap your communicator and send out backup signal.

Let's hope your fellow heroes get here in time.

global violence; violence += 1
global dmg_to_target; dmg_to_target = 3
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch stifles a pained grunt.

global violence; violence += 1
global dmg_to_target; dmg_to_target = 4
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

Backswitch is hit squarely in the chest.

He backs away a step while gasping for air.

global violence; violence += 1
global dmg_to_target; dmg_to_target = 5
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch blocks the telegraphed attack but the sheer force sends him
backpedaling, wincing.

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

global dmg_to_self; dmg_to_self = 2
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.

You move even lower, a poor move, as the manhole cover sweeps your legs and
you land with your back against the ground.

The scramble afterwards to get back into a fighting stance is less graceful
than you'd hoped.

global violence; violence += 0.5
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch points at your weapon and sends you it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch
Idiot.

global violence; violence += 0.5
global dmg_to_self; dmg_to_self = 1 if precision == 0 else 0
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

Backswitch sidesteps your swing and sends a prop sword flying at your face.

You parry the prop sword, reading Backswitch's rhythm.
