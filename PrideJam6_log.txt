There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a

You nearly lose your footing but try for a counterattack.


exec: exec
But your timing's been read and Backswitch lays into you.

Backswitch
Dumbfuck.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

15
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.


exec: exec
A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}gone wrong as a wardrobe full of costumes
goes flying right as you roll, straight into your face.

The last thing you see before you collapse onto the ground is his mask. You
can tell he's got the ugliest smirk behind it.

Being the hero.

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin

You clasp his hands and ask.

16
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch blocks the telegraphed attack but the sheer force sends him
backpedaling, wincing.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

15
You roll for cover, stage props and lighting equipment becoming temporary
shelter for you to catch your breath.

It's a balancing act to not stay in one place for too long however as your
protections could become projectiles with just a gesture from Backswitch.


exec: exec
A balancing act{cps=1.5}... {/cps}that you manage to keep as you catch your
breath between daring manuevers, much to Backswitch's ire.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Wishmaker
Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
Backtalk, smacktalk.

Backswitch
You know who you really need to watch out for? Truck drivers.

Wishmaker
Wait, what does that m-{nw}

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Wishmaker
What does that-

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING

Everyone's thought about it once.

Being the hero.

Shin
{i}But despite getting superpowers...{/i}

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin
{i}...I never get to be the hero.{/i}

You clasp his hands and ask.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin

Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But you fail to notice the floorboard beneath your feet fly off, likely under
Backswitch's power.

 You fall without any ground beneath you.

You land under the stage with a thud before climbing out unceremoniously; a
jeering Backswitch there to greet you as you rise.

Backswitch
Had a nice trip?

You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.

Backswitch stifles a pained grunt.

You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.

Backswitch is hit squarely in the chest.

He backs away a step while gasping for air.

You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.

Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a

You nearly lose your footing but try for a counterattack.


exec: exec
But your timing's been read and Backswitch lays into you.

Backswitch
Dumbfuck.

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You move even lower, a poor move, as the manhole cover sweeps your legs and
you land with your back against the ground.

The scramble afterwards to get back into a fighting stance is less graceful
than you'd hoped.

The last thing you see before you collapse onto the ground is his mask. You
can tell he's got the ugliest smirk behind it.

Shin
This report's going nowhere.

You got up and left the building. On your way out, somebody taps you on the
shoulder.

???
Hey.

You turn around, only to get a cold drink to the face as you do.

Sekibanki
Want a drink?

You take the can of carbonated sweet sickness from his hands before placing it
and your laptop off to the side.

Shin
Good guess, but water's my preference.

Shin
So how was it? The training exercises.

Sekibanki
Usual. The other city's team leader kept arguing with Reimu and we didn't get
anything done.

Shin
Ah.

You went back to typing to try and keep your thought off the fact they didn't
bother bring you.

Sekibanki
Not trying to exaggerate for your sake by the way. It was truly awful.

Sekibanki
What about you? You finish the report?

Shin
Yeah, well, part of it at least.

Sekibanki
Run me through it then. Maybe I can help jog your memory.

Shin
Well at first. it went about as normal as usual.

Shin
A normal kids event, you know, cause-

You glanced at his reaction, squirming a sliver, knowing your next words.

Sekibanki
I'm not allowed {fast}to actually patrol.

There's shattered glass in the stage curtain, shimmering in blue. Your enemy
calls from the skies.

???
Come out, come out wish boy!

Now... now is the time to strike!

Shin
May even your wish come true, someday.

{sc}WOOOOOOOOOOOOO!{/sc}

The sound of tiny applause and unenthused parents rings out from your
audience. It's a sea of small hands pointing to you.

You hear the cue to bow so you do.

We love you Wishmaker!

{i}The smiles, the games, the acting... it's all...{/i}

???
Kids shit.

The fallen mascot suit, in upstage left, took to its feet{fast} and removed
its oversized head to reveal Backswitch.

Minor villain, major nuisance.

He's been around the block, making waves with her gravity flipping powers. As
a relative newbie, this is your first time face-to-face with a villain.

Despite the excited gasps from the audience, the staff begin ushering everyone
out.

Shin
{i}Okay, this is fine. Drop the banter for now, focus on keeping it
together.{/i}

Backswitch
I was wonderin' about the noise following some new hero. Looks like noise was
all it was.

Backswitch
Don't you agree, {bt=6}{color=000000}wish boy?{/color}{/bt}

10
You bring your weapon in for a swing at Backswitch's midriff.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch points at your weapon and sends it flying out of your hands.

You manage to get ahold of it before it goes offstage.

Backswitch's laugh booms from his echoing demon mask.

Backswitch
Idiot.

13
You throw your weight behind your weapon, bringing it down in a wide arc.


exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch sidesteps your swing and sends a prop sword flying at your face.

You parry it as well as you can but still get a bit roughed up.

Backswitch
Iiiiiiidiot.

You hold a defensive stance, keeping distance from Backswitch.

After dodging one or two hits, you start to get a feel for his timing, his
rhythm.

16
You swing with a little too much oomph, nearly lifting you off your feet.


exec: exec

exec: exec

exec: exec

exec: exec
Backswitch steps into range before you complete the swing, throwing a
counterpunch.


exec: exec
You take it on your jaw and the world becomes blurry.

You grit your way through the pain.


exec: exec
While dazed, you tackle Backswitch and land a shot to his knees that make him
buckle.

Backswitch
{sc}{color=000}FUCK!{/color}{/sc}

exec: exec
Tutorial
Often times, opponents will COUNTER or INTERRUPT your action and force you to
make an unknown roll.

You attempt to-


exec: exec
But before you can, you notice the floorboard beneath your feet about to fly
off. You leap backwards out of harms way. Backswitch seems genuinely
surprised.

Backswitch
Not as dumb as you look?

12
You duck Backswitch's blows, weaving in and out of his range.

Seeing this, Backswitch makes a gesture and from across the street, a manhole
cover goes flying in your direction.


exec: exec
You manage to avoid it, leaping from your low position, as it flies underneath
you and crashes into backstage.

Backswitch
Hmm. Not as talkative as your stage persona, are ya?

Wishmaker
Shut it with the backtalk, Backswitch.

Backswitch
Backtalk, smacktalk.

Backswitch
You know who you really need to watch out for? Truck drivers.

Wishmaker
Wait, what does that m-{nw}

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Wishmaker
What does that-

But Backswitch was already running away.

You began to run after him but not before incoming traffic became INCOMING
traffic with Backswitch sent a truck, its tires squealing, toppling sidewards
towards you.

Everyone's thought about it once.

Being the hero.

Shin
{i}But despite getting superpowers...{/i}

You dive out of the way of the truck as its thrown into a nearby freeway,
crashing into traffic. You see smoke. You hear screaming.

Shin
{i}...and I HATE admitting this...{/i}

You run over to one of the nearby pedestrians, picking the one who looks the
most physically capable; the most likely choice.

Shin
{i}...I never get to be the hero.{/i}

You clasp his hands and ask.

Shin
Do you {gradient2=6-E40303-FF8C00-2-FF8C00-FFED00-2-FFED00-008026-2-008026-004
